                            I pride myself on combining a journalist’s instinct for capturing moments with an artist’s eye for composition. From local high school games to NCAA athletics and major sporting events, I provide freelance sports coverage that has reached national audiences. Off the field, I create portraits that feel natural, not staged — and with FAA Part 107 certification, I add cinematic aerial perspectives to events, landscapes, and branding projects.</p>-->

                            Based in Monroe, WI, I serve clients across Madison, Milwaukee, Green Bay, Chicago, and beyond. If you need impactful visuals, fast delivery, and professional storytelling, you’re in the right place.</p>

                    <p>
                        The result? Sports coverage with emotional depth, portraits with personality, and drone imagery with artistry. Images that don’t just document, but resonate.

                    <p>When you work with Second Crop Creative, you’re not hiring “just another photographer.” You’re working with someone who:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Knows how to put people at ease. I’m quick to break down walls and make anyone — athletes, families, or professionals — feel comfortable in front of the lens.</li>
                            <li>Brings an artist’s eye. With a fine art background spanning design, painting, and art history, I approach every photo with composition and storytelling in mind.</li>
                            <li>Has put in the work. With nearly 20 years of experience, I’ve refined my craft through study, practice, and countless assignments — not by chance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        That combination of artistry, professionalism, and people-first approach sets my work apart in sports coverage, portraits, and drone photography.
