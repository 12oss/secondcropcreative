				G Flip’s multifaceted musicianship was on full display, as they seamlessly transitioned from playing the drums to guitar, all while delivering powerful and meaningful vocals. The intimate venue, known for its small capacity and relatively recent establishment, provided an up-close and personal experience for fans, making the sold-out show even more special.
			</p>
			<p>
				Florrie, hailing from the U.K., was a pleasant surprise and an unknown for me. She crushed the opening spot with an impressive set that highlighted her skills as a singer, songwriter, and drummer. Her performance captivated the audience, setting a high bar for the night and leaving a lasting impression with her polished and energetic delivery.
			</p>
			<p>
				G Flip, the headliner, brought an incredible amount of energy from the moment they opened the show on the drums. Known for their dynamic performances and engaging stage presence, G Flip set the tone early with a ground rule: "Rule #1 = Don’t be a dick." This mantra, combined with their open support for the LGBTQ+ community, fostered a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere. The audience was one of the most relaxed and diverse crowds I’ve experienced, full of positivity and acceptance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout their set, G Flip maintained high energy, seamlessly blending their musicianship with heartfelt storytelling. The crowd’s enthusiastic response demonstrated that G Flip’s popularity is on a meteoric rise. The Vivarium, despite its smaller size, was the perfect venue to witness such an intimate and powerful performance, though it’s clear that G Flip is more than capable of filling a venue twice its size. This show was part of their Drummer Tour, currently sweeping through the U.S., and it’s evident that G Flip is well on their way to even greater success.
