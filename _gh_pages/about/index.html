				<h1 class="proxima-nova-black copy-container-left light-primary txt-inherit" style="padding:2%">Who I Am</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Ross Harried, and I’m the photographer, editor, and creative director behind Second Crop Creative. I’m a freelance <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/sports">sports photographer</a> and <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/2/image?editorialproducts=sport&agreements=&family=editorial&phrase=ross%20harried&phraseprocessing=excludenaturallanguage&suppressphrasecorrection=true&sort=newest" target="_blank">wire service contributor</a> based outside Monroe, Wisconsin, specializing in sports coverage, portraits, and branded drone imagery.</p>
				<p>
					I grew up on a dairy farm in southern Wisconsin where the work ethic was simple: “If there’s work to be done, do it.” That mindset shaped me into who I am today — someone who isn’t afraid of long hours, chasing deadlines, and pushing myself to deliver. The biggest compliment I get today is "Do you ever sleep...?"

				<h2 itemprop="headline" class="proxima-nova-black">Why Second Crop Creative?</h2>
				<p>The name <em>Second Crop Creative</em> is a tribute to my upbringing on a Wisconsin dairy farm. Every season, the second crop of hay was the best harvest — richer, stronger, and more valuable than the first. It taught me that hard work, patience, and persistence always pay off. That philosophy has carried through into my photography: put in the work, do it right, and create something worth keeping.</p>
				<p>
					I never wanted this brand to be just about me, which is why it’s not “Ross Harried Photography.” Second Crop Creative reflects not only my roots, but also the support of my wife and three kids. This creative journey is mine, but it’s also ours — a family adventure.</p>

				<h2 class="proxima-nova-black">From Art to Photography</h2>
				<p>Before I ever picked up a camera seriously, I was an artist. I earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the <a href="https://www.uwstout.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin–Stout</a>, studying design, art history, and traditional fine arts. In 2008, I studied abroad at <a href="https://www.dalkeithcountrypark.co.uk/dalkeith-palace/" target="_blank">Dalkeith Palace</a> in Scotland, a pivotal moment in my life. It was the first time I had left the farm, the first time I had been outside the U.S., and it opened my eyes to the world.</p>
				<p>
					That experience sparked a thirst for travel and storytelling that has taken me across Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Today, while I’ve traded a backpack for a camera bag, that same curiosity and hunger for new experiences drives my work behind the lens.</p>

				<h2 class="proxima-nova-black">Life Today</h2>
				<p>Now, I live with my wife and three young kids on a quiet 9-acre stretch outside Monroe, WI. These days, the camera is my passport. It’s taken me to college stadiums, high school fields, live events, and brands across Wisconsin and beyond.</p>
				<p>
					My photography has been featured by outlets like ESPN, The New York Times, Fox Sports, NBC, Forbes, and the BBC, as well as by brands including Panini America. I specialize in fast-turnaround <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/sports">sports coverage</a> for wire services, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portraits">authentic portraits</a>, and branded aerial drone imagery.</p>

				<h2 class="proxima-nova-black">My Difference</h2>
				<p>What sets me apart is more than experience — it’s perspective.
					<ul>
						<li>
							I put people at ease. I know how to help athletes, students, and clients feel comfortable in front of the camera so their true selves shine through.</li>
						<li>
							I’m an artist first. With a fine art background and nearly 20 years of photography practice, I approach every assignment with an eye trained in composition, light, and storytelling.</li>
						<li>
							I’ve lived this craft. From farm chores to long nights editing, I know the value of hard work. Photography isn’t a side hustle for me — it’s my life’s work.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2 class="proxima-nova-black">In Short</h2>
				<p>Second Crop Creative is the story of where I come from and where I’m going. It’s rooted in Wisconsin soil, shaped by world travel, and sustained by a passion for telling stories through photography. Whether I’m filing wire photos from the sidelines, creating portraits with personality, or helping a brand stand out with drone imagery, my goal is always the same: to create visuals that connect.
