							<h3>Responsive Web Design, Wordpress, SEO</h3>
							<p>So this thing called the interwebs kind of took things by storm not too long ago, and as a business or individual, there is a need and desire to have a web presence in todays life. Whether you need a custom built website, or want some help setting up a kick-ass wordpress blog, we are here to assist. In fact, even if you want to put an online resume or a sweet-looking wedding website out there, or heck, I don’t know, a page like hamster dance, we will oblige (as long as it remains somewhat ethical and not damaging to others - litigation is such a drag). All of our custom websites will be responsive, meaning your website will look beautiful on devices from large to small.</p>

						<h3>Buy Original Artwork, Commission Original Artwork, Gift Original Artwork</h3>
						<p class="">We have all been there. What do we get Suzy for Christmas, or what the heck does Levi want for his bar mitzvah? It’s tough to find a gift that is genuinely one of a kind and has meaning. That is why we offer digital artworks from large to small. We appreciate good artwork, and more than that, we appreciate a good gift that has some sort of fiber to it - anyone can buy a new iPod or the hottest set of Dr. Beats, but not everyone is going to have that one-of-a-kind, commissioned artwork hanging on their wall.</p>
