excerpt: Over the past year I have been working feverishly in between dirty diapers, band practice and full time employment to consolidate all of my freelance services (photography, art, design & video) into one digital space. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/12oss/" target="_blank">Ross Harried Photography</a> will no longer be maintained, nor will <a href="http://12oss.com" target="_blank">12oss.com</a> and as a result I would like to invite you all to check out my new page that shows the breadth of services I truly encompass (not just photography), <a href="https://www.facebook.com/secondcropcreative/" target="_blank">Second Crop Creative</a> &amp; <a href="http://secondcropcreative.com" target="_blank">secondcropcreative.com</a>.

			<h1>Freelance Services Reborn</h1>
			<p>Over the past year I have been working feverishly in between dirty diapers, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MadTadders/" target="_blank">band practice</a> and full time employment to consolidate all of my freelance services (<a href="http://secondcropcreative.com/photo-services/" target="_blank">photography</a>, <a href="http://secondcropcreative.com/design-services/" target="_blank">art, design</a> &amp; <a href="http://secondcropcreative.com/video-services/" target="_blank">video</a>) into one digital space.</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.facebook.com/12oss/" target="_blank">Ross Harried Photography</a> will no longer be maintained, nor will <a href="http://12oss.com" target="_blank">12oss.com</a> and as a result I would like to invite you all to check out my new page that shows the breadth of services I truly encompass (not just photography), <a href="https://www.facebook.com/secondcropcreative/" target="_blank">Second Crop Creative</a> &amp; <a href="http://secondcropcreative.com" target="_blank">secondcropcreative.com</a>.</p>

					<h2>Why did you ditch your Name?</h2>
					<p>I chose to part ways with using my name as a front for my ‘brand’ for a few reasons.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Because I want to speak to all the freelance services I offer, I felt it was a better route to take then encompassing everything under my name.</li>
						<li>People don’t know how to properly pronounce or spell my last name to begin with which would make it hard to remember or look up if I met someone on the street that would be interested in the freelance services that I had to offer.</li>
						<li>I wanted to disconnect all my personal social media accounts from any of my freelance services/business endeavors. This way I can choose what content from my freelance services social media accounts to share with my friends and family, instead of bombarding you guys/gals with both my personal social media accounts and freelance accounts &#8211; although lets be honest, I will probably still try and share 70% of my freelance posts.</li>
					</ol>
					<h2>Ok, but what does Second Crop Creative even mean?</h2>
					<p>Trust me when I say I spent probably a solid 2 weeks of just ‘brand-storming’ and trying to see what names I could work with that had a) available website domains as well as b)social media accounts. Unbeknownst to many, I actually grew up on a dairy farm. A regular task of farming is feeding your herd. To feed your herd you must harvest hay &#8211; the second crop of most hay harvests are typically the best/nutritious. Not only was I in the process of starting a family that I would soon have to nourish, but it was my second attempt into personal branding of my freelance services. BAM! <a href="https://www.facebook.com/secondcropcreative/" target="_blank">Second Crop Creative</a> was born offering freelance services ranging from photography and video services to website design and commissioned artworks.</p>
					<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
					<p>Business will continue as usual. Nothing has changed other than <a href="https://www.facebook.com/secondcropcreative/" target="_blank">Second Crop Creative</a> will be the forefront of all my freelance services. This is an exciting transition for my family and I as I look to take on more clients by reaching a broader audience &#8211; not just photography clients. I’m especially excited for anyone interested in <a href="http://secondcropcreative.com/video/" target="_blank">video work</a> and those interested in owning <a href="http://secondcropcreative.com/design/" target="_blank">original artwork</a> to decorate their homes, dorms and/or man caves (more <a href="http://artifulprints.com" target="_blank">info</a> on that later). If you know anyone that would be interested, please share.</p>
					<h2>Thoughts?</h2>
					<p>Feedback is always welcome in the comments section so long as it is more sophisticated than playground vernacular.</p>
