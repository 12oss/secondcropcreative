					<h3>Happily Ever After…</h3>
					<p>Every fairy tale has a beginning. A love story video allows you to show how &amp; why you love your partner and doubles as a love time capsule in case you ever need a reminder of why you love them. You get bonus points by sharing it with the world, in which case people will not only be jealous of your affection towards one another but jealous of the unique keepsake you have to hold onto and share with your children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Think of it as a movie trailer for your baby where you get to decalre his/ her arrival into the world in a distinct manner.

					<p class="">You know what makes a great gift for your kids? Taking all that video you shot when they were younger and splicing that into an epic highlight reel. It could be predominantly sports clips, but it could just be clips of old family video. The nostalgic feel and the river of emotions that will be evoked is pricless. And even though it may be a gift for someone else, it's a
						<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/video"><em>reel</em></a> treat for the parents too (see what I did there…).</p>
